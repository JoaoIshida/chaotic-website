# Chaotic Website

This website was implemented in 12 hours during [Chaos Hackathon](https://systemshacks.com/) managed by Simon Fraser University's (SFU) Software Systems Student Society (SSSS).

## Inspiration
We were inspired to create a CodePen-like website to "teach" about basic programming concepts with Python.

## What it does
The project features many truly infuriating features.

- The code examples are intentionally poorly written.
- The UI is designed to be frustrating with elements like:
  - Inoperable links
  - Self-unchecking checkboxes
  - UI elements falling off the screen
  - Color themes switching to awful ones
  - Code execution button running away from the cursor
  - And more chaotic features.

## How we built it
We wrote the project in Next.js to allow for easy use of animations and component creation.

## Challenges we ran into
- Deciding on the approach to execute the code.
- Issues with styling towards the end.
- Parsing Python to JavaScript

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Creating the awful code examples.
- Partially realizing our slightly over-ambitious goal.

## What we learned
- We should have stuck with our strengths.
- Building a web app requires specific skills.

## What's next for Infuriating CodePen
Not much for this version. In the future, we will pretend to implement a fully functional code-pen using Python display. 
Also, implement a better interface and even more chaotic!!
